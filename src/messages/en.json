In the heart of Oaxaca, locals transform themselves into living art — painted skulls, elegant Catrinas, and costumed spirits who blur the line between life and death. These portraits capture the soul of the celebration: pride, remembrance, and joy interwoven in every expression. Behind each mask is a heartbeat, honoring those who came before with color, laughter, and unshakable spirit.",
